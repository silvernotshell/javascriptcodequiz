# javascriptcodequiz
**Description:**
Coding quiz created to test knowledge of JavaScript

**User Story:**
As a coding boot camp student, I want to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can gauge my progress compared to my peers. 

**Acceptance Criteria:**
Given I am taking a code quiz...

When I click the start button, then a timer starts and I am presented with a question.

When I answer a question, then I am presented with another question.

When I answer a question incorrectly, then time is subtracted from the clock. 

When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, then the game is over.

When the game is over, then I can save my initials and score.
